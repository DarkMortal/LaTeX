## LaTeX, software used for typesetting technical documents. <br>
LaTeX is a free software package created in 1985 by the American computer scientist Leslie Lamport as an addition to the TeX typesetting system. 
LaTeX was created to make it easier to produce general-purpose books and articles within TeX. 
Because LaTeX is an extension to the TeX typesetting system, it has TeXâ€™s ability to typeset technical documents that contain complex mathematical equations. 
This feature made LaTeX popular with scientists and engineers.
